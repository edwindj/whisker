\title{{{Mustache for R}}}
\description{
Whisker is a templating engine for R conforming to the Mustache specification.
Mustache is a logicless templating language, meaning that no programming source
code can be used in your templates. This may seem very limited, but Mustache is nonetheless
powerful and has the advantage of being able to be used unaltered in many programming
languages. For example it make it very easy to write a web application in R using Mustache templates
and where the browser can template using javascript's "Mustache.js"
}
\details{
Mustache (and therefore \code{whisker}) takes a simple but different approach to templating compared to
most templating engines. Most templating libraries for example \code{Sweave} and \code{brew} allow the user
to mix programming code and text throughout the template. This is powerful, but ties a template directly
to a programming language. Furthermore that approach makes it difficult to seperate programming code
from templating code.

Whisker on the other hand, takes a Mustache template and uses the variables of the current environment (or the
supplied \code{list}) to fill in the variables.

\examples{
template <- 
'Hello {{name}}
You have just won ${{value}}!
{{#in_ca}}
Well, ${{taxed_value}}, after taxes.
{{/in_ca}}'

data <- list( name = "Chris"
            , value = 10000
            , taxed_value = 10000 - (10000 * 0.4)
            , in_ca = TRUE
            )

whisker.render(template, data)




base <-
'<h2>Names</h2>
{{#names}}
  {{> user}}
{{/names}}'

user <- '<strong>{{name}}</strong>'

names <- list(list(name="Alice"), list(name="Bob"))

whisker.render(base, partials=list(user=user))

}
